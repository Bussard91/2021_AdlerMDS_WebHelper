# AdlerMDS_WebHelper

The Adler Medical Data Science Web Helper (AdlerMDS_WebHelper) is my first little RShiny-WebApp. 

The aim of this app is to combine various calculations from laboratory medicine and different clinical scoring systems in one small app.

Here is the link zu the "ready-to-use" shinyapps.io-hosted WebApp: https://adlermds.shinyapps.io/AdlerMDS_WebHelper/

You can run this WebApp on your local machine in a R Session using the following code:
```bash
library(shiny)
runGitHub("2021_AdlerMDS_WebHelper", "Bussard91", ref = "main")
```

Notice that the package "shiny" has to be installed.
