# AdlerMDS_WebHelper

The Adler Medical Data Science Web Helper (AdlerMDS_WebHelper) is my first little RShiny-WebApp. 

The aim of this app is to combine various calculations from laboratory medicine and different clinical scoring systems in one small app.

Here is the link zu the "ready-to-use" shinyapps.io-hosted WebApp: https://adlermds.shinyapps.io/AdlerMDS_WebHelper/

Here in this repository i provide my R-Code. Criticism and ideas for improvement are always welcome.
